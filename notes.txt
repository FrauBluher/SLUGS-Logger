Significant Events/States

SD card is disconnected
	Do not attempt to write
	Reinitialize the card when it is put back

Circular buffer is full
	Replace oldest data with incoming data

Circular buffer is almost full
	Allocate only necessary clusters

Circular buffer is empty/almost empty
	Allocate extra clusters


Thought: if it can allocate only as needed at full speed and keep up, why allocate more than necessary? Allocating more at once will not help with speed and will potentially waste card space. (Unless allocating multiple clusters at once is more efficient than allocating one at a time, however this may require manual reworking of library code.)
